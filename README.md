# Introduction 
Technical test from StereoGraph : front part.

# Getting Started
1.	Clone the project : `git clone https://github.com/Gasshette/StereographTest-Front.git`
2.	go to the newly created folder and install packages : `yarn install`
3.	start the project : `yarn dev`
4.	Don't forget to do the same with [the backend](https://github.com/Gasshette/StereographTest-Back) ! 

# Build and Test
`yarn dev` : start the project and open it
`yarn build` : build the project
`yarn lint` : run eslint on the project
`yarn preview` : serve the build on the local server. yarn build must be done before to run the up-to-date build.

# Technical choices & difficulties
MUI : my main and most used framwork to get the job done with a basic material design. Pretty easy to use and yet contains a lot of components.

No real difficulties here, I just spent more time on it than i expected due to my lack of recent training and the sorting by step. I, again, got baited by the shallow copy of destructuration.
I also spent time working on the edition of a project, which is not asked but still a good practice.

No Tailwind nor building entity added. Tailwind isn't really interesting when using MUI and no time left for building entity.
